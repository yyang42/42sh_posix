** Rule 4
**  APPLIED IN RULE 05
**
**  If the current character is backslash, single-quote, or double-quote
**  ( '\', '", or ' )' and it is not quoted, it shall affect quoting for
**  subsequent characters up to the end of the quoted text. The rules for
**  quoting are as described in Quoting. During token recognition no
**  substitutions shall be actually performed, and the result token shall
**  contain exactly the characters that appear in the input
**  (except for <newline> joining), unmodified, including any embedded or
**  enclosing quotes or substitution operators, between the quote mark and the
**  end of the quoted text. The token shall not be delimited by the end of the
**  quoted field.
**  <newline> joining is done before tokenization(cf 2.10.2 Shell Grammar Rules)
